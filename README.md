Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Clone the repository with the following command. 
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Wahyudi-Changra/Shop-website.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd <Shop-website>
Step 2: Set Up the Database
Open your MySQL database management tool, such as phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench.
Create a new database, for example, named shop_db.
Import the SQL file (if provided) located in database/shop_db.sql to set up the initial tables and data.
Step 3: Configure Database Connection
Inside the project folder, locate the config.php file (or create one if itâ€™s missing).

Open config.php and enter your database connection details:

php
Copy code
<?php
$db_host = 'localhost';     // Database Host
$db_name = 'shop_db';       // Database Name
$db_user = 'root';          // Database Username
$db_pass = '';              // Database Password

$conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
Replace root and '' with your actual database username and password.
